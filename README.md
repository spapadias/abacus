# ABACUS: Counting Butterflies in Fully Dynamic Bipartite Graph Streams
**Abacus** is a novel streaming algorithm for butterfly counting in a fully dynamic graph stream, which entails edge insertions and deletions.
**Abacus** estimates the buttefly counts of by making a single pass over the graph stream.

[//]: # (**Abacus** has the following advantages:)

[//]: # (* *Accurate*: **Abacus** is up to 148x more accurate than the baselines.)

[//]: # (* *Fast*: **Abacus** maintains similar throughput to the baselines.  )

[//]: # (* *Theoretically Sound*: **Abacus** always maintains unbiased estimates.)

# Setting up Abacus
Here, we explain how to setup Abacus in order to run from your machine.

## Hardware Dependencies
Any modern x86-based multicore machine can be used to run Abacus. 

## Software Dependencies
Abacus requires `Java 8` or later. Furthermore, abacus utilizes the [fastutil](https://fastutil.di.unimi.it/) java
library (we use `version 7.2.0` and the jar is included in our repo).

## Datasets
The datasets we used can be found [here](http://www.konect.cc/networks/).

If you want to use your own datasets, create a folder at `datasets/` folder
containing your selected dataset.
* Columns must be separated by whitespace ' '.
* Each row must correspond to an edge (u v o).
* o denotes the operation, if `o = 1` then addition, otherwise if `o = -1` then deletion.
* All nodes in the same column must be from the same partition.

### Producing Datasets with Deletions
To produce a dataset that contains edge deletions follow the next steps:
1. Execute the `preprocess.py` script that is located in `src/makis/python/` folder. By doing this the edge insertionos are
   created (each line has `o = 1`) and any potential comments are removed.
2. Execute the `addDeletions.py` script that is located in `src/makis/python/` folder.
   Select a preprocessed dataset from step 1, and insert the deletions ratio(s) (values must be between 0 and 1).
3. You can find each produced dataset in its corresponding folder.

Note that in the `dataset/` folder we have included a reduced version of the *Movielens* dataset with `20K` edges, which we have
preprocessed (all edges have `o = 1`). 

# Running Abacus
For running Abacus execute the `callAbacus.py` script that is located in the `src/main/python/` folder.
For instance, we show the output of Abacus on *Movielens* with `20K` edges and with `Î± = 20%`
deletions ratio:

```
Write the location of the data folder from the project root:
datasets

Write the indexes of the datasets (separated by commas)
__MOVIELENS-20K__             
1: movielens-20k_alpha=0.2.dat
2: movielens-20k.dat          
If you want to use all of them just press Enter
1
These are the selected datasets:
 'movielens-20k_alpha=0.2.dat' 
 
Write the memory budgets (separated by commas)
2000
These are the selected ratios:
 '2000' 
 
Write the step for writing the butterfly counts: >? 2000
We write butterfly counts every  2000 edges

Which random seed to use?: >? 0
We use  0 as random seed

Similarly, for running  Parabacus execute  the `callParabacus.py` script located in the `src/main/python/` folder.
